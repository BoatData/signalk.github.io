#### Instructions for adding posts, pages, etc.

New blog posts go in the _posts folder and should be named YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.<filetype>. The front matter for these
posts should include a title and author. The layout should be 'post'. Markdown, textile and HTML are pretty much the
format choices. Markdown is preferred except in cases where the content is to complex.

Pages that aren't API reference material should be in the root folder, API reference pages go in the api folder. These
don't need a date prepended and their layout should be 'page'.

New navbar links can be addd in _includes/header.html and use Bootstrap classes for styling.
