<h2>Signal K Demonstrator</h2>
<p>
  The Signal K Server reference design is written in NodeJS, the popular development platform based on Google Chrome’s
  JavaScript runtime environment and it can run on a lot of different hardware including x64, arm, arm64, ppc64le,
  power7, power8, and s390x.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most popular hardware platforms for Signal K is the Raspberry Pi, which on a “Processing Power to Dollar”
  ratio, is pretty unbeatable and with so many people using it, getting help and support is much easier than for other
  platforms.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a Raspberry Pi and would like to give Signal K a try, we have prepared a detailed “Getting Started” guide
  that will give you all of the information you need - <a href="https://github.com/signalk/signalk-server-node/blob/master/raspberry_pi_installation.md" target="_blank">Signal K Node.js on Raspberry Pi</a>
</p>
<p>
  A fully working version of the latest Signal K Node-Server is currently running on the Signal K demo webserver and if
  you click on the link below it will open in a new tab. You will be taken to the Server’s “Dashboard” where you can
  then click on the Webapps menu to see some typical Signal K Apps.
</p>
<p>
  This is the same Node Server that you could be running on a Raspberry Pi on your boat and it would be your boat’s
  real data being displayed in your web browser, rather than our demo data.
