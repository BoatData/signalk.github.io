<h2>The Free and Open Source universal marine data exchange</h2>
<p>
  SignalK is about publishing a common modern and open data format for marine use. A format for the modern boat,
  compatible with NMEA, friendly to WiFi, cellphones, tablets, and the Internet. A format available to everyone, where
  anyone can contribute.
</p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>
  Yup. We intend to publish all source code under an Apache 2.0 license and everything else, like protocols and interface
  descriptions, under a CC-BY-SA license.
</p>
<p>
  That means that it is open source, but friendly to companies that want to use it in closed source applications or hardware.
  As long as you contribute back we're happy.
